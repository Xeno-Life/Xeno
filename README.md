# About

Xeno is a meta-search engine inspired by Google designed to burst filter bubbles.

# Why
  
Algorithms control the information we consume in our digital lives.  From personalized search to tailored news feeds to targeted ads, the informational filter bubble in which we all exist is ever-present, and it has already brought about devastating societal consequences.  The term filter bubble was coined by Internet activist Eli Pariser in 2010 and it has only become more and more relevant with time.  How can we empower people to understand the very nature of the bubbles in which they exist and to navigate information space in a free and unconstrained way?  Our answer lies in a combination of algorithmic transparency and meta-search.  

# What
  
Algorithmic transparency is necessary to elucidate the methodologies that are used to personalize the relevance of a piece of information.  If users are able to understand the ways in which their search terms are deviated from the norm in order to arrive at certain conclusions then they will viscerally understand that an algorithm is changing what information they consume.
  
Meta-search allows for the possibility for users to enter and understand multiple different types of filter bubbles.  If users can move freely from a right-wing filter bubble to a left-wing one then they can understand the larger picture of the flow of information online, which hopefully will lead to greater empathy and understanding between different people.
